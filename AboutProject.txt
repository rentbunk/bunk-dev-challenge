1. Scroll Bottom Setting:

Implemented automatic scrolling to the bottom of the expense table in the ListComponent whenever a new item is added or edited.
Achieved this by using ViewChild to access the table's container and creating a scrollToBottom method that scrolls to the container's bottom.
Connected this functionality to the itemAdded event emitted by the AddComponent through event binding in the ListComponent template.


2. Removal of Unnecessary Code:

Simplified and improved the code in your TravelService to handle the status of expense items (e.g., "editing" and "deleting") more efficiently.
Ensured that only one item can be in the "editing" or "deleting" state at a time by resetting the state of any other items to "active" when needed.
